I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca).

My last name, Du ("杜"), means "pear tree". There seem to be equivalents in English ([Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_(surname))), in French ([Poirier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poirier)), and in German ([Birnbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birnbaum_(surname))).
